# comp2005-assessment-template

This is the template for your Comp2005 Assessment. It uses a single repo for both parts (projects), and the repo therefore has 2 folders (which you must not rename):

* part-a-web-service-api (put your Web-Service-API submission for Part A here)
* part-b-fontend-app (put your Frontend-App submission for Part B here)

Refer to the brief document for details regarding what is required in each of these.

Each folder also contains a .gitignore file, which should prevent unnecessary (temporary) files being committed (specific to Java, which is required).
